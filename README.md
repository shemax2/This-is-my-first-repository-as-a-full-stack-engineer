Create and setup your Git and GitHub account
Git and GitHub are powerful tools that allow you to manage your code and collaborate with others. In this project, you will learn how to create and setup your Git and GitHub account, so you can start using them for your projects.

Step 1: Create a Git account
If you haven't already, go to https://git-scm.com/ and create a Git account. This will give you access to the Git software, which you can use to manage your code locally.

Step 2: Install Git
After creating your Git account, you'll need to install Git on your computer. You can download the Git software from https://git-scm.com/downloads, and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Step 3: Create a GitHub account
Next, you'll need to create a GitHub account. Go to https://github.com/ and sign up for an account. This will give you access to the GitHub platform, where you can store your code and collaborate with others.

Step 4: Setup Git with GitHub
Once you have both a Git and GitHub account, you'll need to set them up to work together. Follow the instructions on https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh to setup your Git account with GitHub.

Congratulations! You've now created and setup your Git and GitHub accounts. You're ready to start using them to manage your code and collaborate with others.
